Cold and dry on Mars but everything is my favourite color 
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the mummy will appreciate the lack of umidity
Consider now Venus as a base
Go to Jupyter instead
Let's go to Jupiter


The robot found new rocks at the surface! :D

It was fun to collaborate, thanks!
